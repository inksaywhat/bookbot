# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!


**BookBot** is a simple command-line Python application that reads the text of a book and generates a report based on various text analysis metrics, such as word count, sentence count, average word length, and character frequency. This project was built as part of my learning journey through the Boot.dev curriculum.

## Features

- **Word Count**: Calculates the total number of words in the book.
- **Sentence Count**: Identifies and counts the number of sentences.
- **Average Word Length**: Computes the average length of words used.
- **Character Frequency**: Tracks the frequency of each letter (A-Z) in the text.
  
This project demonstrates my ability to work with Python, manipulate strings, read from files, and implement algorithms for text analysis.

## How It Works

1. **Book Input**: The project reads a text file (such as *Frankenstein* by Mary Shelley, available in the `books/` directory).
2. **Text Processing**: The text is analyzed to compute various statistics.
3. **Report Output**: The results of the analysis are printed to the console in a formatted report.
